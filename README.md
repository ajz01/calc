# A spreadsheet formula parser based on the go compiler.

This package uses parts of the go scanner and parser that
handle expressions, functions, and parameter lists and 
includes some minor modifications to handle formula 
specific tokens such as cell references and ranges.

It's not meant to be particularly useful as is now, just a prototype I'm using to test the concept.
